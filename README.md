# Improvements
I am open sourcing this project as I do not have time to finish it, im busy doing other stuff, and CSGO gambling isn't having a happy ending. This is why you shall expect improvements I haven't completed, however the complete site is working!

Finish Withdraw

Finish 'Status Page' (Staff)

Support proxies instead of having to cache an inventory and not refreshing said inventory until they reopen the deposit page in 4 hours

When user clicks 'Deposit' and 'Withdraw on the Modal, take user to /deposit.php or /withdraw.php, as the modals for depositing and withdrawing, I've stopped using.

Finish footer (Pages for each item) and add footer to every page

Fix resizing issue (chat doesnt resize, hence why if you zoom in too much, the chat covers the screen. Hiding/remove the chat menu doesnt do this)

Make the 'X button' to close and open the chat function

Switch Pricing API

There are some more improvements that also need to be done - I just cant remember. When I do, I will update this list accordingly.
